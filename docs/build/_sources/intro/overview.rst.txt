Overview
=============================
The financial industry operates within a complex environment of regulations
and standards aimed at maintaining market integrity and ensuring reliable
reporting and compliance. These regulations and standards exhibit several
key challenges:

- **Complexity**: Financial products and markets are highly sophisticated,
  demanding detailed and sometimes overlapping regulatory provisions.
- **Frequent Updates**: Regulatory frameworks adapt continuously to reflect
  evolving market conditions, emerging technologies, and new risks.
- **Jurisdictional Differences**: Countries and regions vary in their
  legal systems and economic contexts, adding further complications for
  multinational financial activities.
- **Specialized Terminology**: Precision-oriented language can be difficult
  to interpret, requiring deep expertise to ensure accurate application.

Navigating these intricacies calls for domain-specific knowledge and the
ability to interpret nuanced legal language. Large language models (LLMs),
such as GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Mistral Large 2, have shown remarkable potential
in natural language understanding and generation. However, these models face
unique hurdles in the financial domain, including handling specialized regulatory
language, staying current with rapidly evolving standards, and addressing
concerns related to explainability and ethics.

To help researchers and practitioners address these challenges, we have
developed a **Financial Regulations dataset** that covers a wide range of
regulatory texts and tasks. This dataset underpins multiple initiatives,
including:

1. The `COLING 2025 Regulations Challenge <https://coling2025regulations.thefin.ai>`_,
   featuring nine tasks aimed at pushing the limits of LLMs in interpreting
   and applying financial regulations.

2. A follow-up competition focusing on three core areas:

   - Common Domain Model (CDM)
   - Model Openness Framework (MOF)
   - eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL)

While each event highlights different aspects of the dataset, our overarching
goal remains to expand the community’s understanding of financial regulations
and to foster the development of robust, transparent, and compliant AI-driven
solutions. In this documentation, we provide insights into the dataset's
structure and guidelines for using it in research and real-world
applications.
