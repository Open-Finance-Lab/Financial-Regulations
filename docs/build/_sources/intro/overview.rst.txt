Overview
=============================
The financial industry operates within a labyrinth of complex regulations and industry standards designed to maintain market integrity and ensure reliable financial reporting and compliance. Professionals and organizations grapple with several key challenges:

- **Complexity**: Financial regulations are intricate, reflecting the sophisticated nature of markets and products.  
- **Frequent Updates**: Regulations evolve continually to address technological advancements and emerging risks.  
- **Jurisdictional Differences**: Varying legal systems and economic conditions across countries can complicate compliance for multinational entities.  
- **Specialized Terminology**: Precision-oriented language requires deep domain expertise for accurate interpretation.

Effectively navigating these regulations demands not only subject-matter expertise but also the ability to parse nuanced language and foresee regulatory implications. Large language models (LLMs)—such as GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Mistral Large 2—have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, making them promising tools for automating tasks in the financial domain. However, they also face hurdles in accurately handling specialized regulatory language, keeping pace with ongoing updates, and maintaining interpretability and ethical standards in their responses.

**About the Regulations Challenge**

Originally introduced at `COLING 2025 Regulations Challenge <https://coling2025regulations.thefin.ai>`_, this initiative features nine tasks aimed at pushing the boundaries of LLMs in understanding, interpreting, and applying regulatory knowledge within the finance industry. These tasks address critical issues such as regulatory complexity, domain-specific terminology, ethical considerations, standards compliance, and model interpretability.

In this competition, we have selected three key tasks from the larger Regulations Challenge:

1. **Common Domain Model (CDM)**  
2. **Model Openness Framework (MOF)**  
3. **eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL)**  

By focusing on these three tasks, participants gain hands-on experience with real-world financial data and regulatory scenarios—an invaluable step toward building more robust, transparent, and compliant AI-driven solutions. We invite students, researchers, and practitioners who are passionate about finance and language technologies to develop novel approaches that advance LLM capabilities in addressing the challenges of financial regulations.

In the following sections, you will find task-specific instructions, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Thank you for joining us on this journey to explore and enhance the role of LLMs in financial regulation, and good luck in the competition!
