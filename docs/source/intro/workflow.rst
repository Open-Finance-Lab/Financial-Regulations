Workflow
=============================
In order to encourage the community to develop LLMs that effectively handle multimodal data and tackle the issues of hallucinations and information, participants will follow this structured workflow:

**Use scenarios** We begin with the use scenarios that reflect professional financial regulatory activities including but not limited to legal research, validation, and compliance. 
**Design tasks** By decomposing the above use scenarios, we divide them into capabilities and define corresponding tasks. In this stage, there are nine novel tasks: basic capabilities (five), passing certificates, understanding the Common Domain Model (CDM), and understanding the Model Openness Framework (MOF), and XBRL filings.
**Identify failure patterns** After we evaluate LLMs, we will identify failure patterns.
**Expand testing datasets** The above failure patterns instruct the expansion of testing sets: including questions for observed weaknesses. We create testing questions from multimodal data collected from various data sources, such as legal texts, con- tracts, and financial statements.
**Enhance tasks** The newly expanded question sets are integrated into the tasks. We will also integrate our new tasks and question sets into the Open FinLLM Leaderboard.

This workflow operates as a continuous improvement loop, ensuring that tasks and test sets remain relevant, challenging, and aligned with real-world financial applications.
